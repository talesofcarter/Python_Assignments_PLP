# CORD-19 Data Explorer Assignment

## Overview

This project analyzes a sample of the CORD-19 dataset (~50 papers, <100 KB) to explore COVID-19 research trends. It includes data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files

- **metadata.csv**: Sample dataset with 50 papers, mimicking CORD-19 structure.

- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

## Findings

- **Data**: 50 papers from 2019-2021, with columns like title, abstract, publish_time, etc.

- **Analysis**: Most papers are from 2020. Top journals include PMC and Elsevier sources. Frequent title words: "covid", "transmission", "vaccine".

- **Visualizations**: Bar charts for publications by year and journals, word cloud for titles, and source distribution, displayed directly in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Challenges and Learning

- **Challenges**: Setting up Jupyter environment and handling visualizations in Jupyter.

- **Learning**: Gained experience with pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and wordcloud in Jupyter. Learned data science workflow.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn wordcloud`

- Run Jupyter: `jupyter notebook` and open `analysis.ipynb`

- Ensure `metadata.csv` is in the same directory.
